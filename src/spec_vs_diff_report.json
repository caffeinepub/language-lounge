      "reason": "The diff shows the logo implementation but does not provide evidence of theme-specific styling or testing. The logo file name includes 'dim' suggesting it may be optimized for dark backgrounds, but there's no visible CSS or theme-aware rendering logic to ensure proper display on both themes.",
