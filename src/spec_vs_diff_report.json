  "summary": "The diff implements text chat integration for voice rooms and creates a new video call interface with chat overlay. REQ-29, REQ-30, and REQ-32 are largely implemented with chat toggle, unread indicators, and proper isolation of chat inputs. REQ-31 is partially implemented with a video interface component and chat overlay, but lacks actual video call functionality (consistent with non-goals) and has limited evidence of performance considerations or chat message syncing with room history.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-31",
      "requirement": "Chat messages sync with the room's message history",
      "reason": "The VideoCallInterface component receives messages as props but there is no visible evidence in the diff of synchronization logic or shared state management between the video interface chat and the main room message history",

      "id": "REQ-31",
      "requirement": "Video and chat functionality work simultaneously without performance degradation",
      "reason": "No performance optimization code, lazy loading, or debouncing mechanisms are evident in the VideoCallInterface implementation",
